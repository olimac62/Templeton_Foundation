    "The Big Question underlying this project is: what is the nature of time according to our best physical theories?",
    "In order to answer such a question, the project will start off from a global view on the arrow of time and then move to local contexts. The ultimate goal is two-fold: on the one hand, to elaborate a unified approach to the arrow of time that hinges essentially on geometrical properties of the universe as awhole; and, on the other, to articulate it with local time asymmetries.",
    "The strategic goal of our project is to actively promote the interdisciplinary dialog among physicists and philosophers in Latin America around deep philosophical issues on the temporal nature of our universe.",

    "Philosophers and physicists have been interested in the direction of time since late nineteenth century. Early discussions primarily focused on the seemingly paradoxical relation between thermodynamics and classical statistical classical mechanics: whereas macroscopic thermodynamic systems manifest a clear temporal asymmetry, given by the universal tendency of entropy to increase, microscopic systems rather exhibit a temporal symmetry, given by the time-reversal invariance of the mechanical laws. The first decades of the twentieth century inherit to a good extent this framework: the problem of the direction of time (or of the arrow of time, in Eddingtonâ€™s words) was to provide an explanation that reconciles the irreversibility of macro-processes with the reversibility of micro-processes.",
    "Despite the criticisms that this entropic approach received during the last forty years, it is still quite alive in the scientific and philosophical communities. For instance, contemporary discussions are still frequently posed in terms of time-reversal invariance or of reversibility versus irreversibility, even though they take place in other domains than that of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics; and, nonetheless, entropy increasing behaviors often come up at some point. And those who extended the approach to the cosmological level, needed to rely on very special initial conditions, which render the arrow of time non-fundamental.",
    "This project proposes to develop an unconventional approach to the problem. The general objective is to elaborate a unified approach to the arrow of time that does not hinge essentially on entropy-based and local considerations, but primarily on the geometrical properties of the universe as a whole. This defines a global master arrow of time that articulates with local temporal asymmetries in classical, semi-classical and quantum local contexts. Our understanding of the arrow of time in physics is that it is fundamental, intrinsically geometric (thereby, nonentropic), global, and with local manifestations in classical and quantum contexts.",
